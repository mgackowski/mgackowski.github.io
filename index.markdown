Hi! I'm Mikolaj "Nick" Gackowski. I work on small video game projects, mostly as a designer and programmer at game jams. I mostly work with Unity and C#, though I have a background in Java, and I'm learning C++. I also used to be a freelance video editor, and created [Music Videos Without Music](https://nicksvideoarchive.wordpress.com/category/music-videos-without-music/).

My latest project is [Squirveillance](https://nickadance.itch.io/squirveillance), an adventure game about squirrels under mass surveillance.

I'm open for work on video game projects - don't hesitate to get in touch!
